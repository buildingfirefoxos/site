    ## Building Blocks

    In this pack you will find all CSS, assets, icons and fonts used in Firefox OS as well as HTML examples on how to use them. These Building Blocks are CSS and HTML only. We are working in some Javascript to interact with them.

    ## Icon set

    You’ll find different icon sets, from primary action icons to communications, settings and media icons. They’re available as layered PSD files in vector format, so they’re ideal to be used in different devices no matter the screen size without loosing quality.
